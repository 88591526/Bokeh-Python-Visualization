# Bokeh-Python-Visualization

Working, learning and sharing Bokeh visualizations! 

See my [medium blog posts](https://towardsdatascience.com/data-visualization-with-bokeh-in-python-part-one-getting-started-a11655a467d4) about making bokeh apps. 

The main application is located in the `bokeh_app` folder. To run the application,
open a command prompt, change to the directory containing `bokeh_app` and run
`bokeh serve --show bokeh_app/`. This runs bokeh server locally
and will automatically open in your browser at localhost:5006.
